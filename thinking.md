What are some future things I want to build with Logic Paint?

- I would really like some fun I/O. That will mean getting high-rate data out of
  the browser and over USB/Network.

- Use PocketBase and Svelte!
- Blueprints can be stored directly in PocketBase, as B64 strings
- Use Google and Github for logins
